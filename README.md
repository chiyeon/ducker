# Duckfetch
Duckfetch is a simple, multiplatform system fetcher built with NodeJS. It has been tested with Windows, macOS, Raspberry Pi OS/Debian, and EndeavourOS. It has untested support for most, if not all BSD and Linux distributions.

# Configuration
Duckfetch's output can be altered through a few optional flags, outlined in the help menu, visible with `duckfetch -h` or `duckfetch --help`. The addition options are as follows:
- `-h/--help`: Display help menu
- `-f/--flatten`: Prints horizontally as opposed to vertically
- `-s/--simple`: Removes some of the output
- `-c/--center`: Centers the output
